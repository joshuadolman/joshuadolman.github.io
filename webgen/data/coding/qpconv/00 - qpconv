qpconv - Quake Palette Converter

QPCONV is my first <i>real</i> programming <b>project</b> that I want to take all the way to completion. It is a
command-line utility for converting images into files that can be used in Quake 1 and 2. Part of the problem
qpconv
solves is palettizing the image to fit Quake's predefined 256 color palette.
